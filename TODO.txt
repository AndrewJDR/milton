To-Do
=====

- Bugs
    - MoveFileEx randomly fails with return code 5 - access denied
    - Undo leaves some pixels without redrawing.

- GPU Renderer checklist
    [x] Color picker
    [x] Eraser (sort VBOs)
    [-] Figure out how to get around the FBO size limitations.
        [x] Anti-aliasing (Multisample FBOs, etc)
        [x] >2x Anti-aliasing (resolve in shader)
        [x] Resizing (manage FBO memory, screen_size dependent updates)
    [x] Brush outline
    [x] sort working stroke when clipping
    [x] Brush size preview
    [x] Get rid of texture barrier (use GL blending and change eraser impl.)
    [x] Export to image (draw rect outline, split render func, out of memory handling)
    [x] Undo/Redo
    [x] Unload image
    [x] Layer visibility
    [x] Clip to screen (clip <1px strokes, clip strokes outside window)
    [-] sandwich buffers
        [x] OR Only draw necesary area (background rect. clipping)
    [x] use triangle strips
    [-] LOTS of redundancy in vertex attributes regardless of triangle strips
    [x] eye dropper
    [x] get rid of stencil, use depth buffer
    [x] Single point strokes
    [] end of "infinite" canvas
    [] Deal with 32 bit limits
    [] float<->int. Try out ivec2 attributes.
    [] should brush radius be stored multiplied by SSAA factor?
    [] Profile clipping (debug code to duplicate canvas)
    [] Clear video memory for far-away strokes. Re-create VBOs as needed.
    [] Does it work on AMD?
    [] TODOs in hardware_renderer.cc


    [x] BUG: Intel driver problem
    [x] BUG: triangle invisibility not linked to GUI visibility
    [] BUG: when panning, brush outline doesn't update
    [-] BUG: screen flood-filling
    [x] BUG: redo stack should be cleared of stale data.
    [-] COMPAT: load pre-1.3.X mlt files and scale brush radii by SSAA factor.

- Application
    - Porting (dialogs and File I/O)
        - Linux
        - OSX
        - Ctrl -> Cmd in OSX. Other cross platform binding issues?
