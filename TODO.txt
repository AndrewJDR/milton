To-Do
=====


***

    Hello, person reading this. The reason that there has been very little work
on Milton lately is that I am very busy finishing my undergraduate thesis. I
expect to continue being real productive sometime in mid-November to early
December. Until then, all commits might be minor TODO.txt additions or small
tweaks.
    Rest assured, Milton won't ever be abandoned.

- Bugs
    - Lower GL dependencies so it runs on crappy hardware (as it should)
    - :)

- Milton v0.1.0
    -  GUI
        - Brush / Eraser
            - Image Button
        - Selection rectangle (engine support needed)
        - Brush overlay in software (prettier)
        - Export buttons
            - OS-dependent file-save dialog.
        - F1 help widget
        - GUI toggle key
        - "Export" button
        - Layers (w/engine support)
        - Options
            - GUI scale
        - History slider?
    - EasyTab:

        - Distinction between eraser and pen.
    - Application
        - App data directory
            - Windows (AppData\Local\Milton)
            - Unix (.milton)
        - DPI-aware (gui scale set by default)
    - Performance:
        - Strokes should be sampled based on relative size
        - memcpy when Panning (most users will benefit hugely)
        - Do not redraw when stroking over existing drawing.
        - Adaptive resolution scaling
        - Check valgrind for cache performance from new allocation patterns..
        - 4x4 Blockgroups (morton-order)
        - Undo/Redo: Only redraw necessary area.
        - Amdahl's curse... Parallelize GUI rendering
        - Stress the renderer with a huge drawing. (i.e. Do we need smart spatial acceleration?)
        - AVX backend??
    - Robust save
        - Save to temp file and swap
        - Keep backups
        - Future-proof. Marker for extensions post v1.0
        - Check return values for stdlib funcs.
    - Profile loading
        - Is allocation a problem?
    - Export
        - JPEG (tiny_jpeg)
        - stb_image_write (PNG, BMP, TGA)
    - Brush
        - Support for general, implicitly defined brushes
    - Debug
        - Input recorder for bug replication
    - Canvas
        - Determine precision limits.
    - Playback
        - Store view changes in persist file
        - Playback mode? Separate viewer?
    - Milton Image Viewer
        - Legal crap
            - Separate into Application / Engine.  App is GPL, "Engine" is liberal. For integration with other stuff!
            - *or* Fuck it. Go full MIT
        - Viewer API & examples.
