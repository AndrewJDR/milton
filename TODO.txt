To-Do
=====

- Bugs
    - :)
    - MoveFileEx randomly fails with return code 5 - access denied
        The bigger the file, the likelier it is to fail.

- GPU Renderer checklist
    [x] Color picker
    [x] Eraser (sort VBOs)
    [-] Figure out how to get around the FBO size limitations.
        [x] Anti-aliasing (Multisample FBOs, etc)
        [x] >2x Anti-aliasing (resolve in shader)
        [x] Resizing (manage FBO memory, screen_size dependent updates)
    [x] Brush outline
    [x] sort working stroke when clipping
    [x] Brush size preview
    [x] Get rid of texture barrier (use GL blending and change eraser impl.)
    [x] Export to image (draw rect outline, split render func, out of memory handling)
    [x] Undo/Redo
    [x] Unload image
    [x] Layer visibility
    [x] Clip to screen (clip <1px strokes, clip strokes outside window)
    [-] sandwich buffers
        [x] OR Only draw necesary area (background rect. clipping)

    [] Single point strokes
    [] use triangle strips
    [] end of "infinite" canvas
    [] LOTS of redundancy in vertex attributes regardless of triangle strips
    [] eye dropper
    [] Deal with 32 bit limits
    [] float<->int. Try out ivec2 attributes.
    [x] get rid of stencil, use depth buffer
    [] should brush radius be stored multiplied by SSAA factor?
    [] Profile clipping (debug code to duplicate canvas)


    [x] BUG: triangle invisibility not linked to GUI visibility
    [] BUG: when panning, brush outline doesn't update
    [] COMPAT: load pre-1.3.X mlt files and scale brush radii by SSAA factor.

- Application
    - Porting (dialogs and File I/O)
        - Linux
        - OSX
        - Ctrl -> Cmd in OSX. Other cross platform binding issues?
    - Tablet:
        - Easytab: Distinction between eraser and pen.
        - Easytab: Stylus buttons.
        - Port to Windows API (support non-Wacom devices)
        - Gestures (OSX, Windows)
    - ImGUI details:
        - Image Button
        - Reduce or remove widget rounding
    - Future
        - Brush
            - Support for general, implicitly defined brushes
    - Feature Requests:
        - eraser toggle
        - pressure toggle
        - pressure response graph
        - unzoomable&unpannable layer ("pin layer" feature) ?
        - Perfect AA for exporting

- Polish and/or Debug layer
    - Memory allocation profiler.
    - Input recorder for bug replication

- Milton Library
    - Refactor. Write sample program.

- Distribution
    *- Linux
        - Checkinstall? Manual dpkg?
        - Ubuntu PPA
        - Freedesktop entry, MIME type
    *- OSX
        - Bundle
        - dmg crap
