- Performance:
    *- Async rendering
    *- Make iterative rendering split the screen into chunks
    *- Undo/Redo: Only redraw necessary area.
    - Amdahl's curse... Parallelize GUI rendering
    - Stress the renderer with a huge drawing. (i.e. Do we need smart spatial acceleration?)
        *- Refactor: Do a simple screen cull before rendering, instead of passing the whole thing.
    - 4x4 Blockgroups (morton-order)
