To-Do
=====


***

    Hello, person reading this. The reason that there has been very little work
on Milton lately is that I am very busy finishing my undergraduate thesis. I
expect to continue being real productive sometime in mid-November to early
December. Until then, all commits might be minor TODO.txt additions or small
tweaks.
    Rest assured, Milton won't ever be abandoned.

            - Unix (.milton)
        - DPI-aware (gui scale set by default)
    - Performance:
        - Strokes should be sampled based on relative size
        - memcpy when Panning (most users will benefit hugely)
        - Check valgrind for cache performance from new allocation patterns..
        - 4x4 Blockgroups (morton-order)
        - Undo/Redo: Only redraw necessary area.
        - Amdahl's curse... Parallelize GUI rendering
        - Stress the renderer with a huge drawing. (i.e. Do we need smart spatial acceleration?)
        - AVX backend??
    - Robust save
        - Save to temp file and swap
        - Keep backups
        - Future-proof. Marker for extensions post v1.0
        - Check return values for stdlib funcs.
    - Export
        - JPEG (tiny_jpeg)

    - Milton Image Viewer
        - Legal crap
            - Separate into Application / Engine.  App is GPL, "Engine" is liberal. For integration with other stuff!
        - Viewer API & examples.
