        - Amdahl's curse... Parallelize color picker rendering
        - Stroke Level-of-Detail downsampling based on relative size.
        - Faster eraser and/or opacity rejection.
        - memcpy when Panning
    - Decrease worker memory usage (don't allocate num_points for clipped strokes!)
    - Stress the renderer with a huge drawing.
    - Brush
        - Support for general, implicitly defined brushes
    - Robust save
