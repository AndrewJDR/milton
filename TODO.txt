To-Do
=====

- Bugs
    - :)
    - need to lose imgui focus when toggling visibility
        Can't repro anymore (Try on Win7?)
    - MoveFileEx randomly fails with return code 5 - access denied
        The bigger the file, the likelier it is to fail.

- Performance:
    - Per-layer buffer memory, only redraw working_layer
        - Chunked by visibility? Profile memory usage
    - Undo/Redo: Only redraw necessary area.
    - Async rendering
    - AVX backend??
    - Make iterative rendering split the screen into chunks
    - Amdahl's curse... Parallelize GUI rendering
    - 4x4 Blockgroups (morton-order)
