To-Do
=====

- Bugs
    - :)
    - MoveFileEx randomly fails with return code 5 - access denied
        The bigger the file, the likelier it is to fail.

- GPU Renderer checklist
    [x] Color picker
    [x] Eraser (sort VBOs)
    [] Figure out how to get around the FBO size limitations.
        [x] Anti-aliasing (Multisample FBOs, etc)
        [] >2x Anti-aliasing (resolve in shader)
        [x] Resizing (manage FBO memory, screen_size dependent updates)
    [] Brush outline
    [] Brush size preview
    [] Export to image (draw rect outline, split render func, out of memory handling)
    [x] Undo/Redo
    [] Unload image
    [] Layer visibility
    [] Clip to screen (clip <1px strokes, clip strokes outside window)
    [] Single point strokes
    [] use triangle strips
    [] end of "infinite" canvas
    [] LOTS of redundancy in vertex attributes regardless of triangle strips
