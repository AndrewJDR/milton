Contributing to Milton
======================

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Milton! :)


How can I contribute?
---------------------

- Be nice

    AKA "Put yourself in the shoes of others".

- Submitting bug reports.

    Whenever possible, Include a way to reproduce the bug. A good
description is always good. If it's relevant, the MLT file might be helpful.

- Code

    Patches are welcome. Please submit code with style consistent with the
project's.  If you want to write a big change, let's talk about it
on an open channel (github issues?)

- Art

    If you are reading this and you are producing art with Milton, please let
me know! It's the whole reason that this thing exists. Even better: if you like
Milton, let others know about it. That would be a great contribution.
