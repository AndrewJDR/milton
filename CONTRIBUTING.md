Contributing to Milton
======================

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Milton! :)


How can I contribute?
---------------------

- Submitting bug reports.

    Whenever possible, Include a way to reproduce the bug. A good
description is always good. If it's relevant, the MLT file might be helpful.

- Issues

    The project is young. If you are using Milton and have an itch that needs
scratching, submit an issue.

    I may become more draconic with what issues are accepted after the project
matures.

- Write code

    Patches are welcome. Please submit code with style consistent with the
project. If you want to write a big change, let's talk about it on an open
channel (github issues?)

- Art

    If you are reading this and you are producing art with Milton, please let
me know! It's the whole reason that this thing exists. Even better: if you like
Milton, let others know about it. That would be a great contribution.


Code of Conduct
---------------

    1. Put yourself in the shoes of others.
    2. Be respectful.
    3. Don't take yourself too seriously.
