Milton File (.MLT) format v1
============================

The major number in Milton's version corresponds to the maximum MLT file format
it can read. For instance, Milton x.N.x can read MLT files vN, vN-1, ..., v1.
At the time of this writing there is only Milton v1.x.x and MLT v1.

The files src/persist.(c|h), functions `milton_save` and `milton_load` serve as
documentation for the file format. If this is not enough, please contact me at
